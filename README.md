#Phrase-Hunters
Treehouse Techdegree Project #3
The goal of this game is to guess a random phrase one word at a time. If you miss 5 guesses before you complete the phrase, the game is over. The program will display the length and structure of the phrase including any letters that have already been guessed. The program also verifies the user's guesses to make sure they are not repeating or inputting invalid guesses. Once the game is complete, the user will be given the option to play again.
This project was a great opportunity for me to practice and show off my abilities in object oriented programming.
